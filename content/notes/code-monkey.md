Code monkey is a derogatory term for programmers hired to write simple and
repetitive code. It somewhat echoes the [Infinite monkeys theorem][1] albeit
applied to narrower subject -- which has only [become a reality][2] thanks to
code monkeys.

When asked, Karl Marx GPT, who is quite literal, had much to say:

> The term "code monkey" is a colloquial expression in the tech world!  It
> refers to a programmer or software developer whose job primarily involves
> writing and debugging code, often with minimal involvement in higher-level
> design, strategic decision-making, or creative problem-solving. The term is
> sometimes used humorously or self-deprecatingly, but it can also carry a
> negative connotation, implying that the person is treated as a "cog in the
> machine," performing repetitive or menial coding tasks without much autonomy.
> 
> From a Marxist perspective, the concept of a "code monkey" could be analyzed
> through the lens of alienated labor. In such a scenario, the programmer might
> feel disconnected from the broader purpose or creative aspects of the
> software they are contributing to, reduced to performing repetitive tasks for
> the profit of the capitalist enterprise. Their labor becomes commodified, and
> their potential as creative individuals is subordinated to the demands of
> capital.

I'm thankful that Karl Marx GPT is aware of its Marxist tendencies. It's
straight out of the dated anti-capitalist class-warfare text-book (?);
somewhat alienating and not at all compatible with modern comfort.

Fortunately, Albert Camus GPT, was, fittingly, much more optimistic and
uplifting, although also lacking originality:

> The code monkey, like Sisyphus, confronts a task that often appears
> meaningless or mechanical, shaped by the demands of systems beyond their
> control. Yet, the question of happiness depends on whether they find personal
> meaning in their work -- perhaps in camaraderie, craft, or even rebellion
> against the absurdity of the situation. One must imagine a code monkey happy
> *if* they consciously affirm their role without illusions, embracing the
> absurd and carving out joy amidst the monotony.
