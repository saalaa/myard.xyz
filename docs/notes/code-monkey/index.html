    <p>Code monkey is a derogatory term for programmers hired to write simple and
repetitive code. It somewhat echoes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">Infinite monkeys theorem</a> albeit
applied to narrower subject &ndash; which has only <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info">become a reality</a> thanks to
code monkeys.</p>
<p>When asked, Karl Marx GPT, who is quite literal, had much to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term &ldquo;code monkey&rdquo; is a colloquial expression in the tech world!  It
refers to a programmer or software developer whose job primarily involves
writing and debugging code, often with minimal involvement in higher-level
design, strategic decision-making, or creative problem-solving. The term is
sometimes used humorously or self-deprecatingly, but it can also carry a
negative connotation, implying that the person is treated as a &ldquo;cog in the
machine,&rdquo; performing repetitive or menial coding tasks without much autonomy.</p>
<p>From a Marxist perspective, the concept of a &ldquo;code monkey&rdquo; could be analyzed
through the lens of alienated labor. In such a scenario, the programmer might
feel disconnected from the broader purpose or creative aspects of the
software they are contributing to, reduced to performing repetitive tasks for
the profit of the capitalist enterprise. Their labor becomes commodified, and
their potential as creative individuals is subordinated to the demands of
capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful that Karl Marx GPT is aware of its Marxist tendencies. It&rsquo;s
straight out of the dated anti-capitalist class-warfare text-book (?);
somewhat alienating and not at all compatible with modern comfort.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Albert Camus GPT, was, fittingly, much more optimistic and
uplifting, although also lacking originality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code monkey, like Sisyphus, confronts a task that often appears
meaningless or mechanical, shaped by the demands of systems beyond their
control. Yet, the question of happiness depends on whether they find personal
meaning in their work &ndash; perhaps in camaraderie, craft, or even rebellion
against the absurdity of the situation. One must imagine a code monkey happy
<em>if</em> they consciously affirm their role without illusions, embracing the
absurd and carving out joy amidst the monotony.</p>
</blockquote>
